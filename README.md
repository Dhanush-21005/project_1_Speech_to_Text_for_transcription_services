# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project is a demonstration of a **Speech-to-Text transcription service** using Python. It converts spoken audio into written text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) tools. This can be applied in various contexts such as interviews, meetings, podcasts, or accessibility services.

## Features

- Upload and process audio files
- Transcribe speech to text
- Display and optionally export transcriptions
- Simple and user-friendly Jupyter Notebook interface

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- SpeechRecognition library
- PyDub (for audio preprocessing)
- IPython widgets (for interactive UI)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
```

4. Upload your audio file in `.wav` format and follow the instructions in the notebook.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* `speechrecognition`
* `pydub`
* `ipython`
* `ipywidgets`

## Limitations

* Best results are achieved with clear, noise-free audio.
* Only supports certain file formats (e.g., WAV). May require format conversion.

## Future Improvements

* Support for multiple file formats (MP3, FLAC)
* Language detection and multi-language support
* Integration with cloud-based ASR APIs (Google, AWS, etc.)
